# Kpop Guess Game

This is a kpop guessing game I wrote in java. 
There is a text document named "text.txt" that has a list of kpop groups.
The computer will pick a random group from the list and hide the name with underscores.
The user will guess the group name one letter/number at a time.
The user will have 10 tries total before they lose the game.

You can change the "text.txt" document with whatever words you want.
Do not include spaces in between words and only have one name per line.
